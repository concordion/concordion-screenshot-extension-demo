Introduction
------------------

This project demonstrates the usage of the [Concordion](https://concordion.org) [Screenshot Extension](http://github.com/concordion/concordion-screenshot-extension) with [Selenium WebDriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/).

Example output is shown [here](http://concordion.github.io/concordion-screenshot-extension-demo/spec/demo/ScreenshotDemo.html).
    
Running the tests
---------------------------

The tests use Selenium's ChromeDriver, so you'll need to have:

1. Chrome installed (or you could change the code to use a different driver).
1. [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) downloaded and added to the `PATH` (or the `webdriver.chrome.driver` system property set)
    
The download includes support to run the tests with either <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a> or <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>.  
    
### Using Gradle
1. From a command line opened at the location to which this package has been unzipped, run `gradlew clean test`
1. View the Concordion output under the subfolder `build/reports/spec/demo`
    
### Using Maven
1. Download and install maven (this has been tested with 3.0.3)
1. From a command line opened at the location to which this package has been unzipped, run `mvn test`
1. View the Concordion output under the subfolder `target/concordion/demo`

### Running from your IDE
Import as a Gradle or as a Maven project. This may require additional plugins to be installed to support Gradle or Maven.

Under the `src/test/java` folder, find the `ScreenshotDemoFixture` class in the `demo` package and run as a JUnit test. The location of the Concordion output is shown on the standard output console.


What you should see
--------------------------------
The tests will open a Chrome browser and perform a Google search.
    
### JUnit output
The test should pass successfully, though the console output will show a failure with the message:

> <-- Note: This test has been marked as EXPECTED_TO_FAIL

This test deliberately fails in order to demonstrate the extension.  The example in the specification is tagged with a status attribute of `ExpectedToFail` - the JUnit test passes since it meets this expectation (you'd normally only use this when you have a partially implemented feature).

### Concordion output
The output folder should contain the following specification. (You can see an example of it [here](http://concordion.github.io/concordion-screenshot-extension-demo/spec/demo/ScreenshotDemo.html)).

#### ScreenshotDemo.html
This should show a failing example (red). Hovering the mouse over the failing example will show a screenshot taken when the failure occurred. Clicking on the failure will open the screenshot.

The screenshot extension is configured with a custom `SeleniumScreenshotTaker` class that uses Selenium's [TakesScreenshot](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/TakesScreenshot.html) interface to take a screenshot of the web page.  The extension has a number of [configuration options](https://github.com/concordion/concordion-screenshot-extension#configuration), for example to also take screenshots on successful examples and to set the image width.

It can also be used to [explicitly add screenshots](https://github.com/concordion/concordion-screenshot-extension#explicitly-adding-screenshots-to-the-output) to the Concordion output.
    
Potential Issues
------------------------
### Proxy

If you are behind a HTTP proxy server, you may need to configure the proxy to allow access to www.google.com

The easiest way to do this may be to add the following lines to the Site() constructor:

```java
    System.setProperty("http.proxyHost", "<proxy.host>");
    System.setProperty("http.proxyPort", "<proxy.port>");
```    

replacing `<proxy.host>` with the host name of the proxy server, and `<proxy.port>` with the port number.

If your proxy requires authentication, you will also need to set the properties `http.ProxyUser` and `http.proxyPassword`.

Additional Gradle Files
-----------------------
`publish.gradle` is only needed if you want to publish the output to Github pages.

If copying the project for your own use, you probably won't want this file.
